    About my self
        </h2>
        <p>"Hello everyone, my name is Suriya,<br> and I’m excited to be here today! I come from Thiruvallur 
           in Tamilnadu, a vibrant town known for its rich culture and history. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in 
            Mechanical Engineering at Rajiv Gandhi College of Engineering, where I have the opportunity to 
            explore various aspects of engineering, from thermodynamics to materials science. My studies
            have not only deepened my understanding of mechanical systems but have also ignited my passion for 
            innovation and problem-solving within the field. </p>
